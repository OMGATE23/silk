## üöÄ Technologies Used

Silk is built with a modern, robust tech stack to deliver a smooth and scalable experience.

### Backend

- **Framework:** Flask
- **Real-time:** Flask-SocketIO
- **AI/LLM Integration:** Agno (for Google Gemini interaction)
- **Database:** SQLite

### Frontend

- **Framework:** React
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Charting:** Recharts JS
- **Icons:** Lucide React

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Silk follows a clear separation of concerns, divided into a Flask backend and a React frontend:

**Backend:**
The Flask backend is initialized directly within `backend/main.py`, centralizing the application and SocketIO setup. It uses a dedicated **Flask-SocketIO namespace** for handling real-time AI course generation interactions. AI agents (powered by Google Gemini via `agno`) are integrated to perform course validation, outline generation, and content creation.

**Frontend:**
The React frontend, built with TypeScript, provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get Silk up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js (LTS version recommended) & npm (or yarn)
- Git

### üöÄ 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OMGATE23/silk.git
cd silk
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Install System Requirements (Python, Node.js)
Run the setup script from the project root:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```
This will:

- Check/install Python 3.12+
- Check/install Node.js (LTS) and npm
- Set up Environment Variables

### üì¶ 3. Install Project Dependencies
After system setup, run:

```bash
make install
```
This will:

- Create a Python virtual environment in backend/
- Install backend Python dependencies via pip
- Install frontend dependencies via npm in frontend/

### üìù 4. Configure Environment Variables


The setup file will configure the env but to change them simply do the following
a. Backend Environment Variables
Create a .env file in `backend` if not present:

```bash
touch backend/.env
```
Add:

```bash
GEMINI_MODEL=your_gemini_model_id_here_e.g._gemini-2.0-flash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
DB_PATH=sqlite_db.db
```
b. Frontend Environment Variables
Create a .env file in `frontend` if not present:

```bash
touch frontend/.env
```

Add:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 5. Run the Application
To start both backend and frontend servers concurrently:

```bash
make run
```

Backend runs on: http://localhost:8000

Frontend runs on: http://localhost:5173

## üöÄ Usage

1. Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`).
2. Use the navigation links in the header (`Courses`, `Create Course`, `Analytics`) to explore the application.
3. In the "Create Course" section, you can start creating a new course by providing a description. Observe how Silk generates the course in real-time.
4. Visit the "Analytics" page to see your course progress and insights.
